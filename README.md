<h1>Overview</h1>
The app is a bare-bones, real-time representation of how each algorithm works. The goal is to eventually add every well-known algorithm and showcase how it works behind the scenes.

<br>
<h1>Technologies</h1>
<b>GUI</b>: Java's Swing framework is used, as I was already familiar with it and wanted to learn more.
<br><br>
<b>Logic</b>: Java.

<h1>Information about the App</h1>
<li>Currently, the maximum <b>Array Size</b> is 984 due to the way visualization works.</li>
<li><b>Sorting Speed</b> is adjustable, ranging from 1 (slowest) to 5 (fastest), with 6 representing full speed.</li>
<li>When the <b>Start</b> button is clicked, the app first shuffles the array and then begins sorting.</li>
<li>Clicking the <b>Stop</b> button at any time will halt the current operation.</li>
